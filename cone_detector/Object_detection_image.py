######## Image Object Detection Using Tensorflow-trained Classifier #########
#
# Second Author: Arthur Telles
# Date: 6/4/18
# Description: 
# This code was adapted to perform custom file detection, but its similar to the original.
# Also the angle between the center of the object and the center of the camera is returned.
# Everything was wrapped up in a class to be called by the main control function.

# Description: 
# This program uses a TensorFlow-trained classifier to perform object detection.
# It loads the classifier uses it to perform object detection on an image.
# It draws boxes and scores around the objects of interest in the image.

## Some of the code is copied from Google's example at
## https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb

## and some is copied from Dat Tran's example at
## https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app/blob/master/object_detection_app.py
